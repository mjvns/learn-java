Difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder:

StringBuffer:                                                               StringBuilder:
Contains synchronised methods.                                              Contains non-synchronised methods.
Only one thread is allowed to execute at a time, so this                    Multiple threads can operate at a time because of non-synchronised methods.
object is by default thread safe.                                           So it is not thread safe.
Performance wise relatively low.                                            Performance wise relatively high.
